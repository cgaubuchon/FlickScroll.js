		<p>"In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it's good. Here's a man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man; which is sucked in&mdash;by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So."</p>
		<p>The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.</p>
		<p>"Hold hard!"</p>
		<p>Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log was gone.</p>
		<p>"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the line. See to it."</p>
		<p>"There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?"</p>
		<p>"Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip's missing. Let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess he's holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards here. Ho! there's his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off&mdash;we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here's Pip, trying to get on board again."</p>
		<p>"Peace, thou crazy loon," cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. "Away from the quarter-deck!"</p>
		<p>"The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser," muttered Ahab, advancing. "Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?</p>
		<p>"Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!"</p>
